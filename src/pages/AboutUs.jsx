          <h4>What is the introduction of wine?</h4>
          <p>
            wine, Alcoholic beverage made from the fermented juice of grapes.
            Wine may also be made from various fruits and plant parts. Though
            known by the ancients, wine was not drunk in its matured form until
            the development of the bottle and cork in the late 17th century.{" "}

          <h4>Your Wine Has a Story</h4>
          <p>
            Knowing how various cultures have produced and used wine over the
            years can enhance your wine drinking experience. From the first
            winery hidden in Armenia to the Phoeniciansâ€™ worldwide influence of
            winemaking to the social and spiritual aspects of wine in
            Greco-Roman culture and beyond, wine is much more than just
            fermented grapes in a glass. It's a lesson in history that you can
            savor every time you take a sip.

              A glass of wine and a good book is the ultimate treat on a quiet
              evening in and thanks to one Italian wine company, there's a brand
              new way to enjoy this great pairing. The Matteo Correggia winery
              has teamed up with product design agency Reverse Innovation to
              create a range of wines called Librottiglia. Each bottle, which is
              half the size of a full bottle, has been wrapped in a short story
              to complement the style of the wine. And there's even a clever
              reason behind the smaller bottles - they contain around two
              glasses, which is the perfect amount to get you through each
              "label book."'
